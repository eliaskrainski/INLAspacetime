# Abstract

In this tutorial we illustrate a new implementation of the model proposed in @bakka2019barrier. 
It consider the problem of modeling over a spatial domain accounting for physical barriers. 
The original implementation is illustrated in
[this tutorial](https://haakonbakkagit.github.io/btopic128.html).
The re-implementation consider a new (faster) computational method 
available in the **INLA** package. 
See details at the end of this vignette to update old
working code to use this new implementation.

# Introduction

Suppose that there is a phenomena that varies over a spatial domain. 
Models usually consider correlation between observations made. 
Considering a pair of observations, the correlation is usually specified as 
a function of the distance between the location sites
from where these observations were collected. 
If there is a barrier in the spatial domain, 
this correlation for a pair of observations taken from sites in different 
sides of the barrier shall consider the barrier. 
In resume, it should no longer be just a function of the distance.
Basically, the correlation between points 
in two different sides of the barrier should decay faster (than the usual) 
to zero and "does not cross the domain". 

In order to illustrate the problem, 
let us define a rectangle as our spatial domain: 
```{r domain}
rxy <- c(10, 6)
r <- mean(rxy)
bb <- rbind(
    c(0, 1)*rxy[1],
    c(0, 1)*rxy[2])
domain.xy <- cbind(
    c(0, 1, 1, 0, 0) * rxy[1],
    c(0, 0, 1, 1, 0) * rxy[2])
``` 

We will now set the barrier as the two polygons defined as follows
```{r bdomain}
barrier1 <- cbind(
  cos(seq(0, 2*pi, length=50)) * 0.7 + 0.50 * rxy[1], 
  sin(seq(0, 2*pi, length=50)) * 1.0 + 0.75 * rxy[2])
barrier2 <- cbind(
  c(0.50, 1.50, 1.50, 0.50, 0.50) * rxy[1],
  c(0.33, 0.33, 0.40, 0.40, 0.33) * rxy[2])
```

Define the objects using the \textbf{\textsf{sf}} package:
```{r sfpackage}
library(sf)
domain <- st_sfc(st_polygon(list(domain.xy)))
barriers <- st_sfc(st_multipolygon(
  list(st_polygon(list(barrier1)), 
       st_polygon(list(barrier2)))))
```

We can visualize these polygons in order to make the problem clear:
```{r domainvis}
library(ggplot2)
gg0 <- ggplot() + 
  xlab("") + ylab("") +
  theme_minimal() + coord_fixed()
gg0 + xlim(bb[1, ]) +
  geom_sf(data = domain, fill = "blue") +
  geom_sf(data = barriers, fill = "gray")
```

The problem is to model data in both sides of the barrier considering that the 
correlation between then should account for the barrier. 
The proposed method in @bakka2019barrier 
models the entire domain, including the barrier. 
To deal with the barrier, the correlation range is set to be reasonable shorter 
over the barrier domain than the one at the domain of interest. 
This idea is simple and does not add any parameter in the usual stationary model. 
Furthermore, it can be implemented with any inferential method.

In @bakka2019barrier, the proposed method consider the 
Stochastic Partial Differential Equations - SPDE 
approach proposed in @lindgren2011explicit.
The implementation illustrated in
[this tutorial](https://haakonbakkagit.github.io/btopic128.html) 
deals with a discretization of the domain. 
The discretization should be considered with some care.
The fraction fixed for the analysis interplay with the width of the barrier. 
One should choose a small enough fraction, 
see details in @bakka2019barrier.

We first load the other packages that will be used in this tutorial.

```{r packages}
library(INLA)
library(INLAspacetime)
library(inlabru)
library(patchwork)
```

```{r lic, echo = FALSE}
inla.setOption(
    pardiso.license = "~/.pardiso.lic" 
)
```

# Model definition and discretization

Let us consider that there is an underlying 
random field over the specified domain. 
This random field will be discretized using the mesh
so that a precision matrix is defined for the
distribution at the mesh nodes.
We will define the barrier model as
proposed in @bakka2019barrier
which make use of a triangulation.

# Mesh and triangles

The solution consider a discretization of the spatial domain and 
the simplest one is using triangles.
Therefore we start with the following mesh made up of small triangles 
in the domain and bigger around it.
```{r mesh}
mesh <- inla.mesh.2d(
    loc.domain = domain.xy, 
    max.edge = c(0.03, 0.1) * r,
    offset = c(0.1, 0.3) * r,
    cutoff = 0.01 * r)
mesh$n
```

The solution needs the triangles inside the barrier domain to be identified. 
For each triangle center we check if it is inside or not of the barrier domain
and and create a vector to identify to which domain is each triangle center inside
```{r ibarrier}
triBarrier <- unlist(fm_contains(
  x = barriers, 
  y = mesh, 
  type = "centroid"))
``` 

We can visualize the mesh and color the triangle centers 
using the **ggplot** methods from the **inlabru** package
```{r vmesh}
triCenters.xy <- cbind(
  mesh$loc[mesh$graph$tv[,1], 1:2] +
  mesh$loc[mesh$graph$tv[,2], 1:2] +
  mesh$loc[mesh$graph$tv[,3], 1:2])/3
gg0 + 
    gg(mesh) +
    geom_point(aes(
        x = triCenters.xy[triBarrier, 1],
        y = triCenters.xy[triBarrier, 2])) 
```

Notice that the mesh goes beyond the domain area including a boundary extension.
Then we also had defined the barrier so that it is also defined in this boundary.
Therefore, when building the model over this discretization, the barrier will
be well defined and the behavior of the process will be as intended.

## Precision matrix 

The parameters in this model are the range and the marginal variance,
We also define the range parameter in the barrier so that the method works.
We consider the range for the barrier as a fraction of the range over the domain.
We just use half of the average rectangle edges as the range in the domain
and 10% of it in the barrier. 
```{r rfparams}
sigma <- 1
(ranges <- r * c(0.5, 0.05)) 
```

We now have to compute the Finite Element matrices needed for the
model discretization, as detailed in @bakka2019barrier.
```{r bfem}
bfem <- mesh2fem.barrier(mesh, triBarrier)
```

We now build the precision matrix with
```{r Q}
Q <- inla.barrier.q(bfem, ranges = ranges, sigma = sigma)
```

## Correlation 

We can use the discretized model to compute correlation between pairs of points
in order to check the properties of the model. 
Let us define a function that computes the correlation
from a given set of location to each mesh node location. 
```{r fcorr}
localCorrel <- function(locs, mesh, Q) {
  nl <- nrow(locs)
  ii <- sapply(1:nl, function(i)
    which.min(rowSums(sweep(
      mesh$loc[, 1:ncol(locs)], 2, locs[i, ], "-")^2)))
  b <- matrix(0, nrow(Q), nl)
  for(i in 1:nl)
    b[ii[i], i] <- 1
  cc <- inla.qsolve(Q, b)
  s <- sqrt(diag(inla.qinv(Q)))
  for(i in 1:nl)
    cc[, i] <- cc[, i] / (s * s[ii[i]])
  return(drop(cc))
}
```

Consider a set of locations and compute the correlations with
```{r lcorrels}
locs <- cbind(c(0.4, 0.6, 0.7, 0.5) * rxy[1], 
              c(0.7, 0.6, 0.3, 0.5) * rxy[2])
mcorrels <- localCorrel(locs, mesh, Q)
dim(mcorrels) 
```

We have the correlation from each mesh node to each of the specified locations.
We would like to visualize it as an image so that we have these correlation 
from the location to "everywhere".
Let us build a projector to project any vector from the mesh nodes to a fine grid
and projected with
```{r pgrid}
pgrid <- inla.mesh.projector(
    mesh,
    xlim = bb[1, ],
    ylim = bb[2, ],
    dims = round(500 * rxy/r)) 
gcorrels <- as.matrix(inla.mesh.project(
  pgrid, field = mcorrels
))
```

We can now create a `data.frame` with the expanded coordinates of the pixels
```{r grid.df}
grid.df <- data.frame(
  x = rep(pgrid$x, times = length(pgrid$y)), 
  y = rep(pgrid$y, each = length(pgrid$x)))
```

The correlations can be projected and prepared for plotting with 
```{r gcorrels}
ggcorrels <- do.call(
  rbind, 
  lapply(1:4, function(l) 
    data.frame(grid.df, 
               loc = paste(sprintf("%1.1f", locs[l, 1]), 
                           sprintf("%1.1f", locs[l, 2]), sep = ", "), 
               correlation = gcorrels[, l])))
```


In order to help the visualization of correlations, 
we will dropped the pixels with small correlations, less than $0.1$.
We can now visualize the images with
```{r beval, echo = FALSE, ref.label = 'ggbarriers', eval = TRUE}
```
```{r ggcorrels}
gg0 + 
  geom_raster(
    data = ggcorrels[ggcorrels$correlation>0.1, ], 
    mapping = aes(x = x, y = y, fill = correlation)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ loc) + 
  add.b0 + gg.add ## look to the appendix for the code for this
```

Notice that the model is also defined in the barrier domain.
Therefore we can do computations at the barrier.
We visualized the correlation over the barriers as well, 
and added the barrier borders,
so that we can see the action of the
short spatial range over the barriers.
This visual inspection helps to verify if the short range 
over the barrier domain was set small enough.

# Data simulation

We consider that the random field is observed with noise. 
We first sample from the random field distribution.

## A random field sample

There are several algorithms to sample from a random field 
specified over a continuous domain without barriers.
We will use the already defined precision matrix
to draw a sample at the mesh nodes with
```{r sample}
u <- inla.qsample(1, Q, seed = 1)[,1]
```

These values sampled at the mesh nodes can be projected to a set of small pixels 
for visualization purpose with
```{r usimgrid}
ugrid.sim <- inla.mesh.project(pgrid, field = u)
```

We can now visualize the projected simulated values at the small pixels, 
inclusive those values in the barriers.
```{r uviz}
grid.df$u <- as.vector(ugrid.sim)
gg0 + 
  geom_raster(
    data = grid.df, 
    aes(x = x, y = y, fill = u)) + 
  add.b0 + gg.add ## look to the appendix for the code for this
```

The visualization of the simulated process over the barrier
allows a visual inspection of the model property.
The process in different sides of the barriers 
seen to be independent, as illustrated by the correlation plots.

## Sampling a set of observations

We define a initial set of locations
to consider that we observe the field at these locations.
We start with a set of locations chosen completely at random in the rectangle
domain, including a barrier part
```{r locs0}
n0 <- 500
set.seed(2)
xy0 <- cbind(
  runif(n0, bb[1, 1], bb[1, 2]),
  runif(n0, bb[2, 1], bb[2, 2]))
``` 

Then we check which of these is inside the barrier
```{r ib}
xy.b <- (splancs::inout(xy0, barrier1)) |
  (splancs::inout(xy0, barrier2))
ii <- which(!xy.b)
``` 

The locations to form the data consider only the locations in the desired domain
and outside the barrier
```{r locs}
dataset <- data.frame(
  x = xy0[ii, 1], y = xy0[ii, 2])
(n <- nrow(dataset))
```

To simulate the outcome, we project the field to these locations,
add an intercept and some random noise
```{r dataset}
sigma.e <- 1
set.seed(3)
dataset$outcome <- 
    drop(inla.mesh.project(
        mesh,
        loc = cbind(dataset$x, dataset$y),
        field = u)) + 
  10 + rnorm(n, 0.0, sigma.e)
```


# Model fitting

Here we illustrate the use of the function in **INLAspacetime** to
implement the barrier model as in @bakka2019barrier.
This implementation consider the `cgeneric` computational method that
is useful to implement new models with **INLA**.
This method allows the computations in **INLA** to take full advantage of
parallel computations, achieving shorter computation time than
with the original implementation.

We define the model object with
```{r bmodel}
bmodel <- barrierModel.define(
    mesh = mesh, 
    barrier.triangles = triBarrier,
    prior.range = c(1, 0.01), ## P(range < 1) = 0.01
    prior.sigma = c(1, 0.01), ## P(sigma > 1) = 0.01
    range.fraction = 0.1)
``` 

We use the model formula in the **inlabru** way,
where the `field` will be the name for the spatial effect:
```{r mformulae}
model <- outcome ~ Intercept(1) +
    field(cbind(x, y), model = bmodel)
```

```{r mfitcode, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
result <- bru(
    model, dataset, family = "gaussian")
```
```{r mfit, echo = FALSE}
sresfl <- "result_barrier.R"
if(file.exists(sresfl)) {
  source(sresfl)
} else {
  <<mfitcode>>
  snams <- c("summary.fixed", "summary.random", 
             "internal.marginals.hyperpar")
  result <- result[snams]
  dump("result", file = sresfl)
}
```

The **inlabru** main function can be supplied with only the 
model formula, the data and the family, as follows
```{r fit, eval = FALSE}
<<mfitcode>>
```

# Results

We can see the summary for the posterior marginal distribution for the intercept with
```{r sfix}
result$summary.fix
``` 

For the hyper-parameters the computations were performed in an internal scale.
That is log of range and log($\sigma$), and $\log(1/\sigma_e^2)$.
However, we can transform each of the hyper-parameters from the
internal marginal scale to its scale with
```{r pmargs}
pmarginals <- 
    list(
        data.frame(
            param = "sigma.e",
            inla.tmarginal(
                function(x) exp(-x/2),
                result$internal.marginals.hyperpar[[1]])),
        data.frame(
            param = "range",
            inla.tmarginal(
                function(x) exp(x),
                result$internal.marginals.hyperpar[[2]])),
        data.frame(
            param = "sigma",
            inla.tmarginal(
                function(x) exp(x),
                result$internal.marginals.hyperpar[[3]]))
    )
```

From these transformed posterior marginal distributions we
can extract a summary to compare with the values used to sample the data:
```{r psummar}
rbind(true = c(sigma.e = sigma.e, range = ranges[1], sigma = 1),
      sapply(pmarginals, function(m)
             unlist(inla.zmarginal(m[, -1], TRUE))[1:2]))
```

We can also visualize these these posterior marginal distributions with
```{r pmargsvis, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 4, out.width = "69%"}
ggplot(do.call(rbind, pmarginals)) + 
    geom_line(aes(x=x, y=y)) + 
    facet_wrap(~param, scales = "free") +
    theme_minimal()
```

### The fitted field

We can visualize summaries from the fitted field.
The posterior mean and the standard deviation can be projected into small pixels
and added to the raster data with
```{r umean}
grid.df$u.mean <- as.vector(
  inla.mesh.project(
    pgrid,
    result$summary.random$field$mean))
grid.df$u.sd <- as.vector(
  inla.mesh.project(
    pgrid,
    result$summary.random$field$sd))
``` 

To help the visualization, we will filter the grid pixels 
considering the barriers.
```{r ibarrierpix}
gInBarrier <- 
  (splancs::inout(cbind(grid.df$x, grid.df$y), barrier1)) |
  (splancs::inout(cbind(grid.df$x, grid.df$y), barrier2))
```

We can now visualize the posterior mean with
```{r umeanviz}
gg0 + 
  geom_raster(
    data = grid.df[!gInBarrier, ], 
    aes(x = x, y = y, fill = u.mean)) + 
  gg.add ## look to the appendix for the code for this
``` 

The estimated field, considering the posterior mean shown,
exhibits a different pattern in each side of the barrier,
particularly far from its tip.
Therefore we successfully accounted for the barrier in the model.
See [this tutorial](https://haakonbakkagit.github.io/btopic128.html)
for details and how to visualize the implied correlation between two points.

Similarly, we can plot the posterior standard deviation of the field,
and the data locations used to estimate the model.
This has lower values around more densely sampled locations and
higher values otherwise.
The highest are near the boundaries,
including the boundary at the barriers,
and far from observed locations.

```{r usdviz}
gg0 + 
  geom_raster(
    data = grid.df[!gInBarrier, ], 
    aes(x = x, y = y, fill = u.sd)) + 
  geom_point(data = dataset, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  gg.add ## look to the appendix for the code for this
```

# Appendix A: adapting old code

To adapt code based in
[this tutorial](https://haakonbakkagit.github.io/btopic128.html),
one should consider that there are two new functions implemented,
as detailed bellow:

```{r old2new, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
old2new <- data.frame(
  Old = c("inla.barrier.fem()", "inla.barrier.pcmatern()"),
  New = c("mesh2fem.barrier()", "barrierModel.define()"))
knitr::kable(old2new)
```

The arguments in the new functions have the same names as in the old ones. 
The new function used to define the model has additional arguments. 
See the help of this function for details.

# Appendix B: ggplot reused code

The additional **ggplot2** code used
```{r ggbarriers, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
gg.add <- list(
  scale_fill_distiller(
    type = "div", 
    palette = "RdBu", 
    na.value = "transparent")
)
add.b0 <- list(
  geom_polygon(
    mapping = aes(x, y), 
    data = data.frame(
      x = pmin(barrier1[,1], bb[1, 2]), 
      y = pmin(barrier1[,2], bb[2, 2])
    ), colour = "black", 
  fill = gray(0.9, 0.5)), ##"transparent"),
  geom_polygon(
    mapping = aes(x, y), 
    data = data.frame(
      x = pmin(barrier2[,1], bb[1, 2]), 
      y = pmin(barrier2[,2], bb[2, 2]) 
    ), colour = "black", 
    fill = gray(0.9, 0.5))##"transparent")
)
```
